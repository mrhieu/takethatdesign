As a result, you may\n            be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for\n            the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or\n            other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting\n            responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data\n            charges if you use the app outside of your home territory\n            (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming.
