# Introduction

[Pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com/) is the most popular website you want to visit when it comes to ideas or inspiration. I myself cannot tell how much I like Pinterest in terms of the high quality content and the user experience. I visit Pinterest almost everyday to see photos of watches and sunglasses (my hobby), fashion trends, and design ideas. I'm satisfied with its clean, minimal UI and constantly improved UX.

> I'm an UI/UX lover. I see nice UI, I have to challenge myself to reproduce it 

I always take it serious to keep the code quality high, with clean and self-explained code. When purchasing this, you also get my latest "helper" snippets inside the package to make it more fun to code.

Happy prototyping!

1.Modify the default theme colors to match Pinterest's colors in `src/theme/variables.scss`

```
$colors: (
  primary:    #084f90,
  secondary:  #32db64,
  danger:     #bd081c,// Pinterest primary color
  light:      #efefef,
  dark:       #222,
  white:      #fff,
  muted:      #b7b4b8,
  google:     #3d85fc
  ...
```

2.I personally like the look on iOS so I forced the theme to iOS mode. You can config that to suit your need

```
# in src/app/app.module.ts
IonicModule.forRoot(MyApp, {
      mode: 'ios',// TODO: to have same iOS look for all platforms
      backButtonText: '',
    })
```
