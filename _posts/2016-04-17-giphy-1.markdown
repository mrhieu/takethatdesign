# Introduction

[Giphy](http://giphy.com/) is an online database and search engine that allows users to search for and share animated GIF files (wiki). I knew about this interesting service while I was working on my [Ionic-yahoo-messenger-ui](https://market.ionic.io/themes/ionic-yahoo-messenger-ui) but I didn't spend time on it. Lately, during the development of [Ionic-tinder-ui](https://market.ionic.io/themes/ionic-tinder-ui), I found it again as a undeniable feature, so nothing can stop me anymore. Then the plugin was made. This plugin will also be integrated into the Tinder theme soon.

Not only the Giphy service itself, the source code also includes a beautiful and easy-to-implement messaging UI with auto-expanding input and data structure.

I always take it serious to keep the code quality high, with clean and self-explained code. When purchasing this, you also get my latest "helper" snippets inside the package to make it more fun to code.

Happy prototyping!
