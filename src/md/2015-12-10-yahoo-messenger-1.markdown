# Introduction

[Yahoo messenger](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yahoo-messenger-chat-share/id1054013981?mt=8) surprisingly came back on the internet but unfortunately didn't get a very warm welcome. Yahoo seems to keep updating their app with some interesting features so let's see what they can do. Love the UI though. 

I always take it serious to keep the code quality high, with clean and self-explained code. When purchasing this, you also get my latest "helper" snippets inside the package to make it more fun to code.
