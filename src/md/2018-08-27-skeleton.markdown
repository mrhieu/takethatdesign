# Introduction

Lately in one of my projects, I was looking for a short and simple solution for the trendy ["Skeleton Screen"](https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-speed-up-your-ux-with-skeleton-screens/) (or screen placeholder and so) and It was not easy to pick one. I ended up creating my own skeleton-item and I really liked the idea of reusing it anywhere, in any screens of my app. But please, don't be addicted like that or your users will leave your app soon.

# Preview
