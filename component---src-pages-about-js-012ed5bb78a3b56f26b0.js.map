I remember the very first day I got to know about HTML5 features (geolocation, localstorage, indexedDB, CSS3 animation,…) I immediately dreamed about a world with just web applications, capable of doing anything, accessible from everywhere right in the palm of our hand. I still believe we’ll get there very soon.</p>\n\n            <h3 id=\"hybrid-app-can-be-much-more\">Hybrid app can be much more</h3>\n\n            <p>There were comments that said my themes look so professional, so different, so real. That made me so motivated for the potential of hybrid apps. Hybrid apps can always have more beautiful look, with native feel and rich functionalities. Good news: any web developers with their existing skillset can do it.</p>\n\n            <h3 id=\"create-the-tools-that-do-the-job\">Create the tools that do the job</h3>\n\n            <p>I’ve been working in startups, and I totally understand the moment we found ourselves repeatedly saying: “let’s make this grid view looks like Pinterest”, or “make this list of posts looks like the news feed on Facebook”, or “make this search bar as simple as we see it on Google”… it’s damn true that we don’t have to reinvent the wheel (well, sometimes we do) but take the most out of the proven products in the market. That helps you save a lot of time and effort in development, educating users so that you can spend most of your time focusing on what you meant to do: creating new values with your product ideas.</p>\n\n            <h3 id=\"live-in-my-own-world\">Live in my own world</h3>\n\n            <p>I’m just a normal frontend engineer with a job and some free time. I believe that we should always have some isolated time for yourself to explore your own world. Weekend projects, side projects, or whatever you call it, is your playground to try new things, to learn some trendy technologies, to test your concepts.
